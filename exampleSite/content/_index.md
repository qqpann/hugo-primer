## ExampleSite

Use the `exampleSite` as a reference, or copy to quick satart.

As you navicate through the exampleSite menu,
"About" and "Blog Example" contents are from hugoBasicExample provided by hugo.

"Hugo-Primer" is provided by hugo-primer.
And all of them are optimized to demonstrate how to use hugo-primer.

Notice how we utilize `menu: "main"` in the frontmatter.
And `weight: 1` decides the order they appear in the nav bar.

Finally, `type: "top"` is a special indicatior.
It is supposed to be used at top page.
This page use it too.
As you might notice, "top" page will not have toc like other single type page.
